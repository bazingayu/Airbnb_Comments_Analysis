# Airbnb Comments analysis

In this project, I analyzed the data from the Airbnb website to predict multiple continuous rating 
scores. Two different regression models (Ridge and K-Nearest Neighbors Model (KNN)) will be 
used to the extracted features to predict the scores. In the last, the importance in each model will be 
presented to show which feature is most related to the rating scores. You can see details in the report.
